        Welcome to my Professional Portfolio! My Name is Arjun! I am a programming bootcamper at the University of Birmingham! Located in the West 
        Midlands, I find the university such a promising place for coders and learners like myself to advance into our career and be able to 
        grasp the knowledge on being a full-stack developer within the web or software industries.
        I had chosen to be on this course because I have a passion for technology and wanting to build and create with coding. 
        Some of the things I want to build are software programming, creating games using C++/JavaScript or websites that involve a full-stack level of programming.
